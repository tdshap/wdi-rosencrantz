###Week01-Day03

### MTA - The NYC Subway System

- There are 3 subway lines:
  - The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
  - The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
  - The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.
  - All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are NO other intersection points.
- The program uses the starting line and starting stop and the ending line and the ending stop to calculate the total number of stops.
 - Declare these variables at the top of your ruby code.
- **Get the program to work for a single line before trying to tackle multiple lines**
- Make sure the stops that are the same for different lines have different names (i.e. 23rd on the N and on the 6 need to be differentiated)

---

###Part 1
- Diagram the lines by sketching out the subway lines and their stops and intersection.
- Write the algorithm out in plain English.
  - What are the steps? How does the program flow?
  - Use pen and paper or you can type it up

###Part 2
- Implement!

###Bonus
- Add the following line without making major modifications to your code:
  - The Q line has the following stops: Times Square, Herald Square, Union Square, Canal St.
- Implement a user interface.
