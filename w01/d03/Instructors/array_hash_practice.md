###Array and Hash access

**A. Copy and paste the following data structure into pry:**

`instructors_array = ["Sean", "Neel", "Jeff"]`

1. Use pry to access the string `"Neel"`
2. Use pry to add your name to the end of the array?
3. Use pry to remove `"Jeff"` from the array.
4. Use pry to access the last item in the array. 

**B. Copy and paste the following data structure into pry:**

```
vladimir_putins_brain = { 
  launch_code: "a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE", 
  fav_hobby: "Riding ponies", 
  prideful: true 
}
```

1. Use pry to return the string `"Riding ponies"`
2. Use pry to return the string `"a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE"`
3. Use pry to add the key-value pair `"number_of_wishes" => "three"` to `vladimir_putins_brain`
4. Use pry to add the key-value pair `4 => "four"`
5. Use pry to remove the key-value pair `:prideful => true`

**C. Given the following data structure:**

`boolean_hash = { true => "It's true!", false => "It's false" }`

1. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[2 + 2 == 4]`?
2. What is the return value of `boolean_hash["Jeff" == "Neel"]`?
3. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[9 > 10]`?
4. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[0]`?
5. What is the return value of `boolean_hash["Neel"]`?
6. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[false||true]`?
6. What is the return value of `boolean_hash[false||"Sean"]`?

### Arrays & Hashes
**Given the following data structure:**
```ruby
    users = {
      jeff: {
        github: "jkonowitch",
        favorite_numbers: [12, 42, 75]
      },
      neel: {
        github: "darthneel",
        favorite_numbers: [11, 99, 24]
      },
      sean: {
        github: "sean-west",
        favorite_numbers: [17, 13, 21]
      }
    }
```

1. How would you access Jeff's Github handle (i.e. the string "jkonowitch")?
2. How would you add the number 7 to Neel's favorite numbers?
3. How would you add yourself to the users hash?
4. How would you return the array of Sean's favorite numbers?
5. How would you return the smallest of Neel's favorite numbers?
6. How would you return an array of Jeff's favorite numbers that are also even?
