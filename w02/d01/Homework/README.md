- So far we have established a root page and an about us page for the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
- The problem is that at the moment, it doesn't include any info on its students
- **Goal**: To include student information on the Hogwarts' website
- **Spec**:
  - Create 2 links from the home page, one for Gryffindor students and one for Slytherin students
    - the routes should be `/gryffindor` and `/slytherin`
 - These two pages should include a list of students belonging to each house (have a minimum of 2 students per house)
    - If I click on a students name in the list, I should be taken to a profile page for that student, which should include a brief bio
    - The routes for the students should be `/STUDENT_NAME`, except replace STUDENT_NAME with the name of the actual student
- ***Bonus***:
    - Include pictures of each student
    - Incorporate a [Google Font](https://www.google.com/fonts#ChoosePlace:select) into your page
      - Read the docs to figure out how
    - Add any other pages and style elements that you find interesting
