**Part 1**

- Create a City model
- Using migrations, create a Cities table with the following attributes
  - name
  - state

**Part 2**

This is a client project that you are working on a client project. Use migrations to follow the client's requests

1. *Client*: "You know what, these are fictional cities so maybe keep tracking of states is bad idea. Can you remove the state column from the database?"

2. *Client*: "I've decided that I want to also have the superheros age in our database"

3. *Client*: "This application should also have information for cars. Superheros drive too! Can you make that update?"

4. *Client*: "Secret identity is a bad name for that column on the superhero table, I find it confusing. Change it to real_identity"

5. *Client*: "Keeping track of cars was a bad idea! Remove that table."

6. *Client*: "I want Superheros to be able to have a city they protect. Can you figure out how to have our application do that?"
