---

###What is a development environment?

- In computer program and software product development, the development environment is the set of processes and programming tools used to create the program or software product.

###What is the purpose of the Installfest script

- The Installfest script was created to quickly set up WDI student development environments.
- This means that it installs all the programming tools you would need to develop software.

###So what did it install?

*Command Line Tools*

- Gives extra features and functionality to our Terminal prompts

*Bash Profile*

- We updated a lot of settings for terminal, including color, file paths, etc
- What is bash profile?
  - There is a hidden file in your Macâ€™s user directory named .bash_profile. This file is loaded before Terminal loads your shell environment and contains all the startup configuration and preferences for your command line interface. Within it you can change your terminal promt, change the colors of text, add aliases to functions you use all the time, and so much more.


- You can view your bash profile at any time by typing `subl ~/.bash_profile` into your terminal
