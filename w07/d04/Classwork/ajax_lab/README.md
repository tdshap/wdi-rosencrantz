## AJAX Lab

**Setup**:

In today's `Classwork/ajax_lab` folder.

**Explore**

  1. Open the `explore` folder and examine the `server.rb`, the `server.js`, and the `index.html` files.
  * Figure out what these files are supposed to do and how to use them.
  * Write a comment before every single line of code detailing what that line does and why. In the index.html file you can skip the html tags, but do leave a comment before every line of javascript.
  * Draw a diagram of these programs and how they are connected. Take a picture of the diagram and put it the lab folder.
  
**Enhance**

  1. Copy the explore files to a new folder.
  * In the index.html, create an input tag with a button. A user should be able to type in the title of a movie, click that button and see the year and the actors of that movie displayed in separate `<h4>` tags.
