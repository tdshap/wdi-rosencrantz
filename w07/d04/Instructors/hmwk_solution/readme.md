# Thursday HWMK (Pic Me) solution

This homework solution shows the steps that were taken to complete the assignment.

1. ```gmaps_test.js``` was done first to figure out how to use the google maps api.
2. ```instagram_test.js``` then was completed to figure out how to work with instagram's api.
3. ```server.js``` was the first pass at creating the server code and combines the code from ```gmaps_test.js``` and ```instagram_test.js```
4. ```index.html``` and ```client.js``` were then created to consume the json coming from ```server.js```

After this ```server.js``` was refactored twice:

1. ```server_alternate.js``` was the first refactoring
2. ```server_alternate2.js``` further refactored the code into functions that take callbacks
