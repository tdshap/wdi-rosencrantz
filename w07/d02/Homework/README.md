#Todo app

This will be a list of todo items/cards similar to http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/backbone/

##MVP

 1. There should be an textbox where the user can add a new todo item
  - place this wherever you feel is appropriate
  - pressing enter after entering text should add the todo item to the top/beginning of the todo list
 - All todos should be listed as `<li>`'s underneath a `<ul>` 
 - Each todo item should have a checkbox next to it that when clicked removes that todo item from the list

##:sparkles:Bonus:sparkles:

 - Each todo item should have an up and down arrow that moves that todo item up or down in the list
 - Create a label somewhere that lists the number of todos left to be completed.
  - When a todo is completed this label should be updated
 - When a user clicks ona the text of a todo item it should change to a text input where user's can change the text of the todo
  - Pressing enter after editing text will change that todo and switch it back to plain text
 - Instead of removing todo items when checked, style the todo item to have a 'strikethrough' or some other visual indicator of completeness

##:octocat: Extracurricular :octocat:

 - Host this app on Github using Github pages! Check it out: https://pages.github.com/.
  1. make another git repo for this app, like we did with our projects
  2. make a branch for this repo called "gh-pages"
  3. make sure your main html file is index.html and ya good to go
  4. include a link to your app in a link.txt file that you commit with your hmwk so that we can see it!
