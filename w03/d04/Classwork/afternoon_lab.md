###Hogwarts Registrar
- **OBJECTIVES**:
  - Increase familiarity with Sinatra
  - Work with sending multiple parameters in our POST requests and being able to handle them on the server
  - Writing more and more complex Ruby logic on our server
- **GOAL**: To create a student registration application for the Hogwarts Registrar's Office
- **SPEC**:
  - Create a page at the route `/students/new` with a form so students can register
  - The sign up form should ask for the following student information:
    - Name
    - Age
    - Favorite Spell
  - Create a page at the route `/` that displays all the names of currently registered Hogwarts students
  - Clicking on a student's name should take me to the `/students/show` route and display that specific student's information - Name, Age, Favorite Spell
  - There should be a page at the `/search` route which has a form that allows me to search for a specific student by name to find out if they are registered or not
    - i.e. I should be able to type in "Harry Potter" and find out whether or not he is a currently registered student
- **BONUS**: Sorting Hat
  - Place a button saying "Sorting Hat" next to each student's name on the page for the `/` route
  - Clicking the button will randomly assign the student to one of the Hogwarts houses
  - After a student has been assigned to a house, their name on the page for the `/` route will no longer have the "Sorting Hat" button next to it
  - There should be a page for each house at `/houses/[HOUSE NAME]` that will display a list of every student currently assigned to that house
    - Clicking on a student's name should take you to the `/students/show` route for that specific student
- **BONUS 2**:
  - Have all of the student and house data ***not*** disappear when you restart the server
