### Sinatragram!

Implement a Sinatra web application with the following:

* A home page with a search form. The user can enter an instagram tag and search.
* After the user clicks search, they can see a list of images from instagram with the searched for tag.

BONUS:

* Another search form on the home page that takes a latitude and longitude. Takes the user to a page that shows all of the images close to that lat/long.
* Instead of lat/long, the user types in a city/state. Find out how to convert a city/state into lat long and use that to search instagram.
