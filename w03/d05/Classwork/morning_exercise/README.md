### Grey's Anatomy

1. Read in `greys.txt` from disk into your ruby program. 
2. Turn the unstructured string into an array of hashes for each character/actor in the file:
  ```ruby
    [
      {character: "Dr. Derek Shepherd", actor: "Patrick Dempsey", episodes: 220, start_year: 2005, end_year: 2014},
    ]
  ```
3. Analyze
  * Stars: Create an array with the names of all the actors who have acted in more than 150 episodes.
  * Minor peeps: Count how many actors have been in less than 10 episodes.
  * Dr. please!: Create an array of all the character's with the word "Dr." in their title.
  * 2007: Create an array of all the characters who were on the show in 2007. (NOTE - they may have started before 2007 and ended afterwards.)
