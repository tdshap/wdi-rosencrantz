## Microblog

---

A microblog allows users to create, devour, update, and delete miniature blog posts. You will be creating a team microblog, which allows a group of users to create posts on a shared feed. These posts can reference outside links and scrape useful information from them (like texts and images), and add novel commentary, like "LOLZ" or "haters gonna hate".

####**Update Notice**
Instead of using SendGrid you can use MailGun. A guide has been posted [here](./mailgun_guide.md).



###***MVP***
- **Data Model**:
  - `micro_post`
  - `author`
  - `subscriber`
  - `tag`
- **Required technologies or features**:
  - [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api)
    - Allows an application to send text messages to any phone number
  - [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/index.html)
    - Allows an application to send emails
- **Examples Idea**:
  - A sports team blog or general sports blog
- **User Stories (MVP)**:
  - A user can create a new `micro_post`
  - A user can add an `author` to a `micro_post` when creating it
  - A user can show (ie, see) a given `micro_post`
  - A user can see all of the `micro_post`s as a *feed* (`/feed`)
  - A user can add a "topic" or "hashtag" to a `micro_post` as a `tag`
    - This should be optional to do and the choice of `tag` is up to the user. Not having a `tag` for the `post` should NOT break the application
    - `tag`s can be edited and deleted
  - When a user creates a `micro_post` they can create a new author or choose a pre-existing one from a drop-down menu
  - A user can view an `author`'s page that lists the `micro_post`s that they have created or edited
  - A user can opt to add their email or phone number to receive an update whenever a new `micro_post` is created (using twilio/sendgrid)
    - This text message or email should at least contain the title of the new `micro_post`
  - A user can view `micro_post`s posts by author (`authors/authorhandle/posts`)
  - A user can view `micro_post`s posts by tag (`tag/tagname/posts`)

###***Bonus***

- **Additional Data Model**
  - `snippet`
- **Further User Stories**:
  - A user can reference an existing `micro_post` in a new `micro_post` (ie, *reblog* it)...
  - A user can identify a referenced `micro_post` in a reblog as a separate snippet...
  - A user can write a post that is "sticky" (stays at the top of the feed, or after a previously stuck post) and has a "life" (in seconds, the time until it becomes "unstuck") of up to two weeks...
- **Incorporate Bundler and a Gemfile into your application**

- **JSON Activity Streams and/or Request Response**
  - [Activity Streams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_Streams_(format)) are complex feeds that explain what is happenning on your site. Your AS feed would be served from the endpoint `/as` and would record all the posting activity on the blog. This sort of feed could be generated using a gem, [for example](https://github.com/nov/activitystreams)
  - Alternatively, you can offer up a JSON representation of a single post at the endpoint `/as/post-id` -- a much simpler option.
  - Or you can do both!
  - To get Sinatra to form responses in JSON format rather than HTML, check out this [tutorial](http://nathanhoad.net/how-to-return-json-from-sinatra)
- **Additional API**
  - When viewing a `micro_post` that has a `tag`, also display content from one of the below APIs that has the same `tag` (hashtag)
    - [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api)
    - [Instagram](http://instagram.com/developer/)
    - [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2)
- **Implement responsive web design to your application**
  - [What the heck is responsive web design?](http://johnpolacek.github.io/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/)
- **Snippets**
  - A user can add a link to a `micro_post` as a `snippet`
    - A snippet is similar to how Facebook handles links. When you paste a link to an article on Facebook, it shows you some limited information about it, but clicking it will take you to the full article.
    - Here is an example from Google+: https://developers.google.com/+/web/snippet/
    - Scrape whatever information from the website to put into the snippet
    - You can use the gem `nokogiri` to pull this off, basically you have to grab the html of the page that the link  refers to and parse it to find important information. Then put that information in your snippet.


##### An example of "snippets" in Facebook

When you "post" a status in Facebook, you see an empty field like this.

<img alt="Form where you enter a link." src="https://github.com/ga-students/guildenstern/blob/master/projects/project_one/images/snippet-before.png" width="600px" style="margin: 0 auto;"/>

And when you paste in a link, Facebook displays data as a snippet of information about the page being linked.

<img alt="Form after entering the link. There is structured information, including a title, image and description, not just a link." src="https://github.com/ga-students/guildenstern/raw/master/projects/project_one/images/snippet-after.png" width="600px" style="margin: 0 auto;"/>
