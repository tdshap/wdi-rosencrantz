# Project One

**Build a web-based, CRUD application.</span>**

## Objectives

1. Build confidence as a developer from building something of your own.
-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation.
-  Learn how to request help from other developers.

## Outline

The period dedicated to projects in-class begins the morning of Thursday, September 4. **At 1:30PM on Tuesday, September 9, we will present to our classmates the progress we have made**.

The dedicated project period is known as a ***sprint***. During this sprint, we will have daily ***stand-ups***, or short meetings with our classmates and instructors, every morning at 9:30am. The purpose of the stand-up is to set goals for the day and support one-another in our development tasks. The purpose of the sprint is to fulfill a set of required features known as an ***MVP***, or *minimum viable product*. After you have completed the MVP, feel free to go crazy and write extra features that interest you.

**The end of the sprint is not the end of the project**. The resulting application will be your first possible portfolio piece, and as such it would behoove us to continue to work on it in the months to come.

**Each student will be responsible for their own project**. This means the student has written every single piece of code that is not a part of a library, either by themselves or during a pair programming session. More importantly: **the student must be able to explain what every piece of code does**. Do not include code you do not understand!

## Instructors

**The instructors will schedule pair programming sessions with each student**. Beyond that, **each student will only receive help from the instructors by using [GitHub's Issue Tracker](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)**. We will do our best to get to your issues, but understand there will be problems you need to solve on your own or with a classmate. 

In order to receive that help, **the issue must include all of the necessary parts of a good question**:

  1. a description of what you are trying to do,
  -  what error or problem you are having, and
  -  what you have tried already.

If it's a conceptual problem, the issue must include:

  1. what you want to do,
  -  what you see as possible solutions, and
  -  what resources you have already consulted about the problem.

## Feature Sets

#### [Microblog][microblog]

<span style="color:gray">A microblog allows users to create, read, update, and destroy miniature blog posts. A microblog allows a group of users to create posts on a shared feed. These posts can reference outside links, scrape useful information from them, and add novel commentary to the linked content.</span>

#### [Forum][forum]

<span style="color:gray">A forum is an application that allows users to both post information and to comment on other's posts, or tag the other posts with metadata. One of the most important functions of forums is to allow "voting" on content to determine it's popularity.</span>

#### [Wiki][wiki]

<span style="color:gray">A wiki is an application that allows users to create and modify content collaboratively. In a wiki application, the history of a document and changes to it are an important part of what they are. Wikis can chart and connect content from a variety of sources, and the interaction of users working on them.</span>

#### [Dashboard][dashboard]

<span style="color:gray">A dashboard aggregates information for a user from a number of sources. The application offers a list of sources (known as *feeds*), and allows them to set preferences to choose which feeds to receive, and to personalize those feeds, by (among other factors) location and topic or interest.</span>

## Requirements

While finishing the MVP features is the primary *goal* of the project, there are further requirements that **must be completed** before or immediately after the project is due.

1. The project should live in a separate git repository and be hosted in a public repo on GitHub
-  Write a `Readme` that includes:
  - the project's name and description,
  - APIs or Gems used and descriptions of each,
  - instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
-  Deploy the application to Heroku (this will be the version of the application that you share with the class).
-  Present your work to the class on the final day of the project, and participate in the class retrospective.
-  (after) Write a blog post about some aspect of the experience. [Examples can be found here](https://medium.com/wdi-nyc-jan-2014).
