#### Put My T-Shirt On
  - Define a __Shirt__ class
    - upon __instantiation__ (meaning the creation of a new object of the `Shirt` class), the class's `initialize` method should expect 3 arguments:
      - `size`
      - `color`
      - `text`
      - __Set these arguments to instance variables of the same name in the initialize method__
    - instantiate a new shirt, `pearl_jam_t`, which is extra-large, a nicely faded black, and says "Yield Tour 1998"
    - instantiate another new shirt, `hipster_plaid` which is size medium, the color red, says "NO LOGO" on the back

#### Baby You Can Drive My Car

  - Define a `Car` class. Its `initialize` method should take 4 arguments and set them to instance variables.
    - `year`
    - `make`
    - `model`
    - `color`
  - write an __instance method__ called `start_engine` that returns the string `"Vrum vrum vrum!"`
  - instantiate a new car, `dads_miata`, which is a red Miata and was produced by Mazda in 1992.
    - call `dads_miata`'s `start_engine` method
  - instantiate one more car, `travs_first_car`, which was a maroon 1995 Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra SL.
