In your own words: what is a database?

A database is an organized structure that holds information using meaningful and consistent methods. 



List some problems with using files instead of a database

Organization isn't enforced: objects in the arrays don't have to be uniform. They can have hashes, integers, objects with differing attributes, nested arrays ect. all in the same file. 

Text file merely holds information we write to it.


What is a schema (google may confuse you here)

Schema enforces consistency on the data you collect. The database creator chooses a schmea by deciding 1. what data to collect, 2. the data type in which each is collected, and 3. how the data relates to each other (or other databases).


When you are not specifically adding/deleting or querying your database, is it still running?
Is this sense, a database is the same as a textfile: it is always there and only "does something" when we call to read, write, or delete it. The database is a textfile with rules.
